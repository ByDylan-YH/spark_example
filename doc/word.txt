MySQL Enterprise Monitor is designed to monitor one or more MySQL servers The monitoring information is collected by using an agent MySQL Enterprise Monitor Agent The agent communicates with the hosts and MySQL servers that it monitors collecting variables status and health information and sending this information to the MySQL Enterprise Service Manager
The information collected by the agent about each MySQL server and host you are monitoring is sent to the MySQL Enterprise Service Manager This server collates all of the information from the agents As it collates the information sent by the agents the MySQL Enterprise Service Manager continually tests the collected data comparing the status of the server to reasonable values When thresholds are reached the server can trigger an event (including an alarm and notification) to highlight a potential issue such as low memory high CPU usage or more complex conditions such insufficient buffer sizes and status information We call each test with its associated threshold value a rule
These rules and the alarms and notifications are each known as a MySQL Enterprise Advisors Advisors form a critical part of the MySQL Enterprise Service Manager as they provide warning information and troubleshooting advice about potential problems
The MySQL Enterprise Service Manager includes a web server and you interact with it through any web browser This interface the MySQL Enterprise Monitor User Interface displays all of the information collected by the agents and lets you view all of your servers and their current status as a group or individually You control and configure all aspects of the service using the MySQL Enterprise Monitor User Interface

The information supplied by the MySQL Enterprise Monitor Agent processes also includes statistical and query information which you can view in the form of graphs For example you can view aspects such as server load query numbers or index usage information as a graph over time The graph lets you pinpoint problems or potential issues on your server and can help diagnose the impact from database or external problems (such as external system or network failure) by examining the data from a specific time interval
The MySQL Enterprise Monitor Agent can also be configured to collect detailed information about the queries executed on your server including the row counts and performance times for executing each query You can correlate the detailed query data with the graphical information to identify which queries were executing when you experienced a particularly high load index or other issue The query data is supported by a system called Query Analyzer and the data can be presented in different ways depending on your needs
